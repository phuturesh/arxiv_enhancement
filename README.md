# ArXiv Enhancement Tool

1. Add citation numbers in arxiv search results, and sort them by the numbers.
2. Click on the extension's icon to toggle across *abs* and *pdf* links. (Compatible with [Alphaxiv](https://alphaxiv.org), though there is no difference between "www.alphaxiv.org/abs" and "www.alphaxiv.org/pdf")
